# [Kepler-SOI](https://caioja.github.io/Kepler-SOI/)
This code lets the user control a spacecraft in a 4 body system with keplerian motion by the approximation of spheres of influence (SOI). All trajectories shown are analytical, calculated again on every change in speed inputed by the user.

With the arrow keys the spacecraft is controlled and the arrows in the top left corner control the velocity which the time passes (time warp velocity).

For Elliptical trajectories the orbits are shown in blue.
